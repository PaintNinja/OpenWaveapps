Documentation webapp changelog
-------------------------------

v0.1b
------
* Bugfix: The webapp now properly closes after opening up the documentation - no more residue console windows!
+ For a more seamless experience, the Documentation console is launched in a minimised state and only restores to a normal state when downloading the latest documentation. This means you will no longer see a console window flash before the Documentation opens up. You will now only see it when it is currently downloading the latest documentation - hence improving performance.
* Bugfix: Documentation updating now functions correctly

v0.1a
------
+ First version
